First, I installed Jenkins, and did the following configuration so I can sync it with my Github repository.

In my github repository you may find all the files I used to do the jobs. https://github.com/kpapagiannopoulos/trg_assignment

Something didn’t work with my Jenkins while I was trying to push the image so I used for my test case the default hello-world public docker image. You may find on the repo the Jenkins file I configured.

I have configure my DockerHub user and pass secretly through Jenkins.


As far as k8s part, I configured it with minikube. You may find on my repo all the yaml files I used and that would do the job.


Installed argo cd and created the relevant namespaces.
I created a service to expose the application internally through the cluster. Then I created an ingressRoute to define how Traefik should route external traffic. I used Traefik’s middle ware feature to add access control to IngressRoute. 

As far as SSL certificates,  I created certificates from: https://letsencrypt.org/ and created a k8s secret. Then I modified the ingress route.



1.	Kubectl apply -f hello-world-deployment.yaml
2.	Kubectl apply -f hello-world-argocd.yaml
3.	argocd app sync my-python-app
4.	kubectl apply -f hello-world-service.yaml
5.	kubectl apply -f hello-world-ingress-route.yaml
6.	kubectl apply -f hello-world-access-control-middleware.yaml
7.	kubectl apply -f hello-world-tls-secret.yaml
8.	kubectl apply -f hello-world-ingress-route.yaml
9.	kubectl create namespace staging
10.	kubectl apply -f devops-roles-bining.yaml
11.	kubectl apply -f qa-roles-bining.yaml
12.	kubectl apply -f dev-roles-bining.yaml
13.	kubectl apply -f argocd-qa.yaml
14.	argocd app sync my-python-app
15.	echo "Deployment process completed."

This is a simple bash script I would use. In order to automate it more I would use helm.



To split the group rights I used RBAC Roles and Role Bindings. To setup passwords for each we may use built in mechanisms like kubeconfig or we may integrate a provider like LDAP.


What we could improve is the following:
1.	Enhance security policies
2.	Implement logging and monitoring
3.	Backup and disaster recovery
4.	Documentation
5.	private repo and image repo
